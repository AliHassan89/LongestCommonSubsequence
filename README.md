# LongestCommonSubsequence
Given two sequences, find the longest subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears
    in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.
    For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”.
```
    e.g
    LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH”
    LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB”
```
